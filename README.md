# Hello-world
Just another repo


Hello, I am Saloni. I am interested in climate change and their adaptation and mitigation. For the analysis, I am looking forward to use tensorflow and pandas library in python.
I believe AI technology is an effective way to deal with climate change; but on the other side I got to know the huge data analysis around the world is contributing 2% of GHG emission and that seems to bea lot. I am studying this topic in depth and also I am eager to get some solutions out of it asap.
